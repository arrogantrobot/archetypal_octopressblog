    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/arrogantrobot/textruder" title="textruder github">Textruder</a> is the next installment in a long line of <a href="http://archetyp.al/cellular-automata-rule-explorer" title="cellular automata rule explorer">one-dimensional cellular automata implementations</a> on various platforms and various media. This adventure begins like so many, on the command line. The inspiration for this project came from reading one of <a href="http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/articles/ca/83-cellular/" title="wolfram 1983">Stephen Wolfram's papers on cellular automata</a>. The original output of the programs testing the concepts of cellular automata was not graphical in the sense of directly mapping each cell to a pixel or block of pixels. Instead, they simply used the command line to emulate this behavior, printing out a new line for each iteration of the row of cells, with an "*" character representing the on cells and a space for the off cells.</p>

<p>So I set about making a command line version of the one-dimensional cellular automata. After using <a href="http://www.cmake.org/" title="cmake website">cmake</a> extensively for my day job, I found it to be an excellent tool for organizing C++ projects. So this project is built in cmake.</p>

<p>This project began simply as a command line cellular automaton and grew to become something a little bigger. It is now a program which will "extrude" any ascii printable text through the pattern of a one-dimensional cellular automaton. So instead of simply printing out a "*" character each time an "on" cell was encountered, I decided to print the next character of the specified source material. Textruder accepts both ascii text files and standard in.</p>

<p>This causes the source material to be extruded through the pattern of the cellular automaton. I have used the same method applied in my android live wallpaper <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farawaylabs.android.emergentwallpaper" title="Emergent Wallpaper">Emergent Wallpaper</a> of randomly picking from a short list of interesting rules and allowing that rule to play out for a random interval before randomly selecting a rule from the list again and changing to it. This results in a continuous stream of non-repeating patterns without the need for human intervention. So the user of Textruder need only run the app and provide input, and the rest will happen automatically.</p>
