While attempting to embed the coderwall badges via the [provided coderwall includes][0], I found that the default coderwall css/javascript was not playing nicely with octopress. So, to the internets! There I found a nice post on this very topic, from the [Code Alchemist][1] blog. He rolled his own solution, which even includes an "endorse" button. Not bad. Thanks!
