![Apache Spark Logo](http://spark.apache.org/images/spark-logo.png "Apache Spark")

This is meant to be a repository of useful Spark information, links, projects, etc.

##Spark For Bioinformatics
* [ADAM][3] - an API for genomics on Hadoop/Spark from [Big Data Genomics][4]
* Check out my [description of Spark][0] with a [simple bioinformatics example][1]

##Helpful Links
* [Apache Spark][2] Project home at apache.org
* [Dean Wampler's Spark Workshop][5], complete with solutions and excellent follow along examples
* [Spark Quick Start Guide][6] - a good intro to Spark Shell and simple Spark apps in Scala, Python, or Java
* [Spark & Data Science][9] - an article by [Cloudera's][10] [Sean Owen][11] on the Data Science landscape, and how it slopes towards Spark
* [databricks][13] - a Spark vendor
* [Apache Spark Youtube Channel][22] - chock full of wonderful content

##Interesting Spark Projects
* [MLLib][7] - a machine learning library built from Spark
* [SparkR][8] - run functions and or closures on a Spark cluster from an R script
* [GraphX][12] - efficiently express graph computation at scale through Spark

Apache Spark originated at Berkeley's [AMPLab][14].

##Spark on Twitter
* [@ApacheSpark][15]
* [@AMPLab][21] - the Berkeley lab where Spark began
* [@deanwampler][17] - from [@typesafe][18]
* [@sean_r_owen][11] - data science at cloudera
* [@GeoTrellis][16] - GeoSpatial framework on Spark

##Talks
* [Dave Patterson][19] - faculty member at [@AMPLab][21] talking about the [future of big data and genomics research][20]
* [Dean Wampler talking][23] about the connection between [databricks][13] and [typesafe][24] and the ecosystem in general
